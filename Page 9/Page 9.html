                Rushia is a soft-spoken, somewhat naive girl who panics easily. While she is usually innocent and kind, she can occasionally become enraged and scream in an uncharacteristically beast-like manner before regaining her composure (for example, while playing Dark Souls or Mario Kart). She is infamous for her extremely poor anger management skills; in addition to screaming, she will often violently smash her fist against her desk. This behavior was previously regarded as breaking character, but it is now mostly considered part of her character.

                Rushia is sensitive about her breast size, and both fans and other hololive members often tease her for it, to the point that she will flinch whenever she hears someone say "flat" (ぺったん)", "wall" (壁) or "cutting board" (まな板). She also has a humorous "yandere" persona that occasionally surfaces when people start talking too much about other VTubers instead of her.

                She greets her viewers with Konrushi 「こんるし」 and ends with Otsurushia 「おつるしあ」.
